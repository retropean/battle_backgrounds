# battle_backgrounds
Processing script that we will use to project images inspired by the backgrounds in the battle scenes of SNES RPG EarthBound at a live performance.

The original formula comes from <a href="https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds">gjtorikian's Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds</a>, but is expanded for our own distortions as seen fit.
