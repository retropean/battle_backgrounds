# battle_backgrounds
Processing script that we will use to project images inspired by the backgrounds in the battle scenes of SNES RPG EarthBound at a live performance.

The original formula comes from <a href="https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds">gjtorikian's Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds</a>, but is expanded for our own distortions as seen fit, including frequency, direction, and speed modifications on the fly, and microphone input to modify visual frequencies.

Built in Processing 3.3.7 and with control panel ControlP5.
